# HDR-Imaging-with-FPGA
High Dynamic Range imaging with Altera DE2-115.

This repository features HDR imaging with Altera's FPGA, DE2-115.
You can read `DCLab_report.pdf` to learn more about this project.

The folder `src/Full` contains all the files required to build the project, while the folder `src/Image_test` sends image data from a PC to a monitor and displays the image.

If you want to implement VGA connection, `src/VGA_test.sv` is a good example.
